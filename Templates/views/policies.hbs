            Privacy Policy
        </h4>
        <p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or
            make a purchase from scaglione.it (the “Site”).</p>

        <span class="light-heading">Personal information we collect</span>

        <p> When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including
            information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on
            your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or
            products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how
            you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”.
        </p><br>

        <p>Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain
            information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information (including
            credit card numbers), email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as “Order Information”.
        </p><br>


        <p>When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device
            Information and Order Information.</p>

        <span class="light-heading">How do we use your personal information?</span>
        <p>
            We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfil any orders placed through the Site
            (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices
            and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:
            - Communicate with you;
            - Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and
            - When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising
            relating to our products or services.</p>

        <p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular,
            your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics
            about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and
            advertising campaigns).
        </p>

        <h4>
            Refund Policy

        <span class="light-heading">Refunds</span>
        <p>
            We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund was
            approved or not. If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method.
